# DeepDeek R1 Experiments ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–

Welcome to the "deepdeek-r1-experiments" repository, where we explore the capabilities of deep seek & o1 auto coders which write Python code from a simple description and iteratively improve it, fixing errors along the way.

## Overview

In this repository, we delve into the world of artificial intelligence and automated coding, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with machine learning algorithms. Our goal is to create a system that can understand natural language descriptions of a program and generate Python code to execute those instructions. Through iterative improvement and error correction, the system aims to become more accurate and efficient over time.

## Repository Content

Here's what you can find in this repository:

- **Codebase:** Contains the Python scripts for the deep seek & o1 auto coders.
- **Data:** Sample datasets used for training and testing the coding algorithms.
- **Results:** Output files showcasing the performance and progress of the coders.
- **Documentation:** Detailed information on the algorithms, methodologies, and experiments conducted.

## Experiments

We conduct various experiments to test and enhance the capabilities of the deep seek & o1 auto coders. From simple tasks to complex challenges, our experiments aim to demonstrate the potential of automated coding systems and their ability to learn and adapt.
